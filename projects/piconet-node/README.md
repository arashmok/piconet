# PicoNet Node - RFM69 Wireless Communication

A wireless communication system built for Raspberry Pi Pico 2, implementing point-to-point and broadcast messaging using RFM69 radio modules.

### Key Features

- **Addressed Communication**: Each node has a unique address for targeted messaging
- **Broadcast Support**: Nodes can send messages to all nodes in the network
- **Reliable Transmission**: Automatic acknowledgment and retry for unicast messages
- **CSMA Protocol**: Carrier Sense Multiple Access for collision avoidance
- **Flexible Addressing**: Configurable address filtering (none, node-only, or node+broadcast)
- **USB Serial Logging**: Real-time monitoring of transmission and reception

## üì° Network Architecture

The system operates on **433 MHz** frequency with the following addressing scheme:

- **Node Addresses**: 0x01, 0x02, 0x03... (unique per device)
- **Broadcast Address**: 0xFF (all nodes receive)
- **Packet Format**: Variable length with CRC validation

### Communication Modes

1. **Unicast with ACK**: Reliable point-to-point messaging with automatic retries
2. **Broadcast**: One-to-many messaging without acknowledgment
3. **Listen Mode**: Continuous reception with address filtering

## üîß Implementation Details

### RFM69 Driver (`common/rfm69.c`)

The driver provides a high-level API for wireless communication:

- **Initialization**: Configures radio parameters (frequency, modulation, addressing)
- **Transmission**: Handles packet formatting, transmission, and ACK waiting
- **Reception**: Manages interrupt-driven packet reception and filtering
- **Power Management**: Optimized sleep/standby mode transitions

### Sender Application (`sender/main_sender.c`)

**Node Address**: 0x01  
**Target Address**: 0x02

**Functionality**:
- Sends timestamped messages every 3 seconds
- Alternates between unicast (with ACK) and broadcast modes
- Implements simple CSMA before transmission
- Provides transmission status feedback via LED and serial

**Message Types**:
1. Unicast: `"Hello from Sender 0x01 - Count: X (UNICAST)"`
2. Broadcast: `"Hello from Sender 0x01 - Count: X (BROADCAST)"`

### Receiver Application (`receiver/main_receiver.c`)

**Node Address**: 0x02  
**Address Filter**: Node + Broadcast

**Functionality**:
- Continuously listens for incoming packets
- Automatically sends ACK for unicast messages
- Displays received data with RSSI and sender information
- Visual feedback via LED on packet reception

## üìä Protocol Features

### Packet Structure
- **Header**: Target address, sender address, packet flags
- **Payload**: User data (up to 61 bytes)
- **CRC**: Automatic error detection

### Reliability Mechanisms
- **Acknowledgment**: Automatic ACK for unicast messages
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 transmission attempts
- **CSMA**: Listen-before-talk to avoid collisions
- **RSSI Monitoring**: Signal strength indication

### Address Filtering Options
- `ADDR_FILTER_NONE`: Accept all packets
- `ADDR_FILTER_NODE`: Accept only packets for this node
- `ADDR_FILTER_BOTH`: Accept node-addressed and broadcast packets

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards
- RFM69 radio modules (433 MHz)
- Pico SDK environment set up

### Building
```bash
cd piconet-node
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico2_w
make -j4
```

### Flashing
1. Hold BOOTSEL and connect Pico via USB
2. Drag `piconet_sender.uf2` to one Pico
3. Drag `piconet_receiver.uf2` to another Pico

### Monitoring
Connect to USB serial at 115200 baud to view transmission logs and received messages.

## üîç Testing and Debugging

### Expected Behavior
- **Sender**: Alternates between unicast and broadcast every 3 seconds
- **Receiver**: Logs all received packets with RSSI values
- **LED Activity**: Blinks on successful transmission/reception

### Troubleshooting
- Check wiring connections match pin mapping
- Verify both modules use same frequency (433 MHz)
- Ensure adequate power supply for radio transmission
- Monitor serial output for initialization errors

## üìà Performance Characteristics

- **Range**: ~100-500m (line of sight, depending on antenna and environment)
- **Data Rate**: 4.8 kbps (configurable)
